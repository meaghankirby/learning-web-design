  <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
  <p>posted by BGB, <time>November 15, 2012</time>
  <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i> sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>.</p>
  <p>Next month, we will be serving <b> Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30. </p>
  <p>Location:<br>Baker's Corner, Seekonk, MA</p>
  <p>Hours:<br>Tuesday to Saturday 11AM to midnight</p>
