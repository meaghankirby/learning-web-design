  <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
  <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, <dfn>you submerge the food</dfn> (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>.</p>
  <p><i>Next month</i>, we will be serving Souse Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us <b>before</b> November 30.</p>
